CHALLENGE #2

Summary
We have a nested dictionary/Json, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get
back the
value. How this is implemented is up to you.
Example Inputs
object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}
key = a/b/c
value = d
object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a

Hints
We would like to see some tests.
We would expect it in any other language. (Prefer Python)
Please don’t use any libraries for this challenge.
